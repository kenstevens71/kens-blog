Back when Eve took a bite of the forbidden fruit God already had a plan for us to become reconciled with Him through Jesus Christ, His son. We even see a glimpse of His plan back in Genesis 3.

Gen 3:8-15
(8)  And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
(9)  But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?”

The question was God's way of bringing man to explain why he was hiding, rather than expressing ignorance about man's location. Shame, remorse, confusion, guilt and fear all led to their clandestine behavior. There was no place to hide.

(10)  And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.”
(11)  He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”

Adam's sin was evidenced by his new knowledge of the evil of nakedness, but God still waited for Adam to confess to what God knew they had done. The basic reluctance of sinful people to admit their iniquity is here established. Reluctance is still the issue. When sinners refuse to repent, they suffer judgment; when they do repent, they receive forgiveness.

(12)  The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”

Adam pitifully attempted to put the responsibility on God for giving him Eve. That only magnified the tragedy in that Adam had knowingly transgressed God's prohibition. but still would not be open and confess his sin, taking full responsibility for his action, which was not made under deception.

(13)  Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

The woman's desperate effort to pass the blame to the servant, which was partially true, did not absolve her of her responsibility for her distrust and disobedience toward God.

(14)  The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
(15)  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

After cursing the physical serpent, God turned to the spiritual serpent, the lying seducer, Satan, and cursed him.

This "first gospel" is prophetic of the struggle and it's outcome between "your seed" (Satan and unbeliever's, who are called the devil's children in John 8:44) and her seed (Christ, a descendant of Eve, and those in Him), which began in the garden. In the midst of the curse passage, a message of hope shone forth--the woman's offspring called "He" is Christ, who will one day defeat the serpent. Satan could only "bruise" Christ's heel (cause Him to suffer), while Christ will bruise Satan's head (destroy him with a fatal blow).

I bet you thought the devotion was finished at this point. You's be mistaken. Now we will get into the rest of the devotion. Please turn in your bible or your bible apps on your electronic device to Colossians 1:21-23.

Col 1:21-23
(21)  And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,

The Greek term for alienated means "estranged," "cut off," or "separated." Before they were reconciled, all people were completely estranged from God (Eph 2:12-13).

Eph 2:12-13
(12)  remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
(13)  But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

The Greek word for enemies can also be translated as "hateful." Unbelievers hate God and resent His holy standard because they love "wicked works". Actually, there is alienation from both sides, since God "hates all workers of iniquity." (psalms 5:5)

Referring back to Ephesians 2:12-13:

Here we see God's work among us. Remember what you used to be, Paul says to the Gentile Christians. "You were at one time without Christ. without hope, without God. You were in trouble. You had no hope for a Messiah. You had no knowledge of God. You had no future."

What does "reconcile" mean? Simply this, if you planned to meet me at McDonald's exactly at 7:45 it would be imperative that our watches be reconciled, or in agreement. Notice Paul says we are reconciled to God--Not He to us. God didn't change His watch. No, we were the ones that were messed up and out of sync.

(22)  he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him,

Christ's substitutionary death on the cross that paid the the full penalty for the sin of all who believe made reconciliation possible and actual.

(23)  if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.

Act 11:23
(23)  When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,

Act 14:22
(22)  strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.

In conclusion:

Those who have been reconciled will persevere in faith and obedience because, in addition to being declared righteous, they are actually made new creatures (2 Cor 5:17) with a new disposition that loves God, hates sin, desires obedience, and is energized by the indwelling Holy Spirit (John 8:30-32; 1 John 2:19). Rather than defect from the gospel they heard, true believers true believers will remain solid on Christ who is the only foundation (1 Cor 3:11), and faithful by the enabling grace of God (Php 1:6; Php 2:11-13).
