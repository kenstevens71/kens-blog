Announcement: This is an announcemrnt of a second blog. Originally. I was going to use this blog to hold both personal blogs and devotions. But I changed my mind. I decided to start a second blog dedicated to devotionals/Bible Study.

I am starting with this blog with a study of Romans. Romans is a very important book in the New Testament. Current It contains two introductions. It has a general introduction and since it had a great influence in Martin Luthor and the Protestant Reformation... The second introdution is based on Martin Luthor.

I Hope you will read both.
