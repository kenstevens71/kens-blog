Life can take unexpected turns, and sometimes those turns come with challenges we never anticipated. In my case, a simple misstep led to a life-altering experience: breaking my hip. This blog post chronicles my journey from the moment of the accident to the subsequent hip replacement surgery and the recovery process that followed.

<h2>The Accident</h2>

We had spent the majority of the day celebrating my wife's 52nd birthday; We had a great time, In the Philippines Birthdays are a big deal. When you get to be my age, it's just another day to me.

That evening we were relaxing when our youngest decided to talk back to her mother. Of course, she was speaking in Tagalog. You might ask, How could you tell? I can always tell by her tone of voice. In any case, I got up to swat her, I was wearing only socks on my feet and her floor was very slippery. So, I fell on my backside with the majority of my weight landing on my nether region.

I didn't realize I had broken anything until I tried to stand. The pain was excruciating.

Now, if I still lived in the United States I would have called am Ambulance and been brought to the hospital. But here we live in a province where good hospitals are few and far between.

Anyway, that first night, I crawled and partly dragged by my wife into our bedroom. Since I couldn't get into bed I spent the first night on the floor of our bedroom.

The next day, I suggest we call a friend of ours and ask him if he could find a few young people to help me into the bed. Well, he came over, but by himself. I don't know how they managed it, but they managed to get me into the bed. On Monday, March 6, I was taken to Tacloban and taken to RTR. A semi-real hospital. I had X-rays taken and they confirmed I had a broken hip. They could not perform the necessary operation there, they claimed they did not have the necessary specialists.

Well, the ambulance could not come to pick me up that night so it required an overnight stay in the hospital. The next day we headed back to Hinunangan and I stayed in bed until March 16th. It took that long to arrange an ambulance to take us to Ormoc. From Ormoc we had to take a ferry to Cebu. Once in Cebu we went to Cheng'Qua hospital.

Before I came to the hospital I got rid of my medical from the US including medicare. Which was a mistake now because this hospital actually took it. But I was sure no one outside the US would take medicare.

<h2> At the hospital</h2>

They X-rayed my entire body, I guess to make sure nothing else was broken. I was in the hospital from March 16th to April 13th. One thing I found troubling is the hospital wouldn't let me leave until my bill was paid in full. Another thing that would not happen in America. They basically held me prisoner until we could pay the bill. Through the generosity of friends and family I managed to pay the bill.

<h2>Recovery</h2>

The recovery journey has not been without its challenges. There were moments of frustration when progress seemed slow, and setbacks tested my resolve. However, with the unwavering support of my family and friends, I pushed through. Every step, no matter how small was a step towards reclaiming my Independence.

I'm still not fully recovered. At my age, we recover at a slower rate. However, I managed to take my first steps a few weeks ago. I'm slowly regain my strength and I hope to be back to my old self soon.
