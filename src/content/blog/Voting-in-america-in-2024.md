This is something I've never done in this platform. Try to influence how people should vote in America. In this case though I am trying to influnce how Christians should vote in this election. The issues are just too important to stay silent any longer.

There is a group called Evangelicals for Harris that true believing Christians should not follow. Don't pay attention do what she says, we should follow what she does. She believes in killing the unborm, threy have redefoned marriage, they have comfused genders... amd much more.

Trump is not perfect, far from it. He's human with many of the human faults.

## Why a Christian should vote for Donald Trunp

In the realm of politics, Christians often seek leaders who align with their values and beliefs. For some, Donald J. Trump represents a candidate who upholds certain principles that resonate deeply with their faith. Here are several reasons why a Christian might consider voting for him:

## Pro-Religious Freedom

Donald Trump has been a staunch advocate for religious freedom. He has taken steps to protect the rights of individuals to worship freely, which is a cornerstone of Christian practice. For instance, during his presidency, he emphasized the importance of churches and other places of worship, even deeming them essential during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Pro life stance

Trump’s administration has been notably pro-life, advocating for the protection of the unborn. He was the first sitting president to speak at the March for Life, demonstrating his commitment to this cause. For many Christians, the sanctity of life is a fundamental belief, making his stance on abortion a significant factor.

## Support for Israel

Trump’s policies have shown strong support for Israel, a nation that holds a special place in Christian theology. His administration recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy there, actions that many Christians view as fulfilling biblical prophecy and supporting a key ally.

## Criminal Justice Reform

Under Trump’s leadership, significant strides were made in criminal justice reform. The First Step Act, which he signed into law, aimed to reduce recidivism and provide better opportunities for rehabilitation. This aligns with the Christian principle of redemption and the belief in second chances.

## Combatting human traffiking

Trump’s administration took a strong stance against human trafficking, allocating substantial resources to combat this modern-day slavery. Efforts to protect the vulnerable and bring justice to perpetrators resonate with the Christian call to care for the oppressed.

## Economic Policies

Trump’s economic policies, including tax reforms and support for small businesses, aimed to bolster the economy and provide opportunities for all Americans. For Christians who value hard work and economic stability, these policies might be appealing.

## Conclusion

While not all Christians may agree with every aspect of Donald Trump’s character or policies, these points highlight why some might choose to support him. It’s essential to approach political decisions with prayer, discernment, and a focus on aligning one’s vote with their faith and values.
