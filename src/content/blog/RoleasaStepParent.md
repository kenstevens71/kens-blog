Today I will talk about my role as step-parent. When I first came to the Philippines my wife expressed interest in me helping her discipline the girls. I really wasn't comfortable with that task, but because my wife expected it of me, I took it on anyway.

Both girls are extremely stubborn, what they didn't count on is I could be more stubborn than they. If you look up the word "stubborn" in an English dictionary, you would see a picture of me.

They each displayed their stubbornness in different ways. Tintin would try to actually fight me. She'd hit me to no effect. She'd used to fight her mother and she used to be able to hurt her mother. So, I think she was surprised and a little frustrated that her blows had no effect on me.

I think part of what she felt was the feeling of abandonment she felt when her father left her and her mother. He enrolled Tintin in a private school and then left, leaving her with the bill. I ended up paying for her schooling in the private school.

Today, Tintin is 18, will be starting her second year of college and has become a mature, beautiful young woman who loves her father (me). She's doing very well in college. At the end of the first year she received a medal for being an outstanding student. I am very pleased with her performance.

Then there is Ashley. Her stubbornness is expressed not so much in physical action, but with words. She tends to talk back to her mother and to me, although she does it in Tagalog which I don't understand. So, it's often difficult to know whether she is actually talking back. Although I can usually tell by her tone of voice whether she is talking back or not.

Ashley like most Filipinos is addicted to her phone. She'll neglect her chores because she is busy staring at the screen of her phone. So, as discipline to her, I just take away her phone for as long as it is necessary. That usually works.

She's smart. She's been on honors since the 6th. grade. So academically she will do well.

My hope for her as she grows in maturity she will become like her older sister and she will learn to bridle her tongue. Otherwise, I fear it will get get her into trouble.

In closing, I'd like to express my thankfulness to God for bringing me to the Philippines and my everlasting gratefulness for giving me such a beautiful and loving family. It is my reward, I think, for living a life full of faith.
