## Introduction

Before I delve int0 the Failure of the Democratic party, I nust introduce a former Democrat who had much todo with my views on how the Democratic party is failing America and continues to fail America. When she first became interested in rubbibg for office it was as a Democrat. But she became an Independent after her tenure in Congress.

## Early Career and Historic Firsts

Born on April 12, 1981, Gabbard made history as the first Samoan-American to become a voting member of Congress. She was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the remarkable age of 21. 🗳️
Notably, she also holds the distinction of being the first Hindu member of the U.S. Congress. 🕉️

## Military Service

Gabbard’s commitment to service extends beyond politics. She served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard, with deployments to Iraq (2004-2005) and Kuwait (2008-2009). Her dedication to both her constituents and her country is commendable.

## DNC Vice Chair and Independent Stance

During her time in Congress, Gabbard served as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016. She later made headlines by endorsing Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination race. 🌟

In a surprising move, Gabbard announced in October 2022 that she had left the Democratic Party to become an independent. Her decision reflects her commitment to principled politics. 🗳️

## Criticisms and Media Presence

Gabbard frequently appeared on Fox News, where she criticized the Barack Obama administration for its reluctance to label radical Islam or Islamic extremism as the real
debates and discussions. 📺

In summary, Tulsi Gabbard’s journey combines military service, historic firsts, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. Her recent shift to independent status adds another intriguing chapter to her story. 📜12
