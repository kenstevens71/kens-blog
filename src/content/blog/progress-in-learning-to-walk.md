As I mentioned, back in March I broke my hip and had hip replacement
surgery. Since then my goal has been learning to walk again. Well, it
finally happened, Last week I took my first steps without a walker or
a cane. My gait is not whee I need it to be, but I am getting there.

It is crucial to approach the post operative period with patience and
care, particularly when relearning how to walk.

In the beginning you may require assistance from a physical therapist
or a family member. They can provide support and guidance as you
practice weight shifting, balance, and proper gait
mechanics. Gradually I gained confidence and independence. Believe me when
I say that it has been a long, slow journey.

Maintaining proper posture while walking is essential for optimal
recovery. Keep your head up, shoulders back, and abdomen engaged,
Avoid leaning forward, or favoring one leg over the other. This last
item I haven't done very well. I still favor my left leg over my right
leg. Primarily because I'm still plagued with pain in my left leg. Of
course, being almost 70 years old doesn't help much, I am sure. I take
small steps right now which I will gradually increase over time.

Well, that is my latest in my progress.
