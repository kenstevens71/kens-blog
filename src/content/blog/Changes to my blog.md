Those of you that have been following my blog will notice some changes to the formmat of my blog. The main change is that I started using Astro rather than eleventy. I believe this will allow more flexibility in this blog with adding new things.

Probably the first thing you notice is the gallery page is gone. The pictures that was on the gallery has been moved to introducing my family blog post. I made this a featured blog post and I think it will remain featured for the foreseeable future.

The blog posts are paginated, Three blog posts per page. Anoher change I made was I put a tag page wjere you can read my devotions. if your interests take you there. Although I do hope you read the entire thing,

[Email](mailto:kensarco120353@gmail.com) me to give mw feedback on what you think of my new, improved blog.
