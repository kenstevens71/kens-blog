This entry should have been posted four days ago, on December 3rd. That is the actual
date of when I was born. I turned 70 years old on that date. I didn't think I would
make it to 70, but praise God, I did.

Turning 70 is a significant milestone in my life. It is a time to reflect on the past
and look forward to the future.

Although physically I haven't notice much difference between 69 and 70, I still suffer
from severe arthritis in my knees, ankles, and hands. I think the arthritis in my knees
and ankles hinders my ability to walk after my hip replacement surgery.

My cognitive functions haven't diminish much. My short term memory has degraded some,
but I don't believe anyone else can notice. I also learn slightly slower.

So, I welcome myself to my 7th decade of life. Praise God for keeping me here this long.
