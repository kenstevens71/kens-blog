Happy New Year to all! I realize I am 19 days late, but I was spending my time changing my blog to use Astro rather than eleventy. Not that there is anything wrong with elevemty, its a fine tool, but I believe Astro offers more in the way of flexibility. I believe it offers more technical solutions.

Does anyone havw any New Years resolutions they would like to share. The only resolutions I made is to grow closer to God with each passing moment. I know that with God's help, I shall do it. God knows I cannot do it on my own.

We spent New Years eve welcoming the New Year in a tradional filipino manner. With good food, spaghetti, pancit, meatballs, etc... and we can't forget the cake. After all, it is the birth of a New Year. At the strke of midnight we held hands and shouted at the top of lungs "HAPPY NEW YEAR!"

A good time was had by all.

So, without further ado, I wish 2023 goodbye and a hearty Hello to 2024.

So to all I shout out "HAPPY NEW YEAR"! May all your dreams come true for this new year.
