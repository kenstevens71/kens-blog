Merry Christmas. Yes, Christmas season is approaching. My purpose is to share the difference between the customs in the Philippines and the United States, my country of origin.

In the Philippines Christmas is celebrated as early as September, and the season lasts until the first week of January. The country is known for having the longest Christmas season in the world. Filipinos the season with carols, food, and unique traditions that make Christmas extra special. One of the most commonly observed practices during the season is the midnight mass or Simbang Gabi or Miso de Gallo. Most people believe that a wish may be granted to those that will complete all nine masses. After Simbang Gabi, Filipinos also look forward to freshly cooked bibingka and puto bumbong -- Signature Filipino holiday treats that are sold in the street to fill the bellies of hungry churchgoers. To make Christmas traditions truly special and unique for a memorable and #KakaibangPutoPasko try topping this Christmas favorites with Magnolia Kesomg Puti ice cream to add flavor and make them tastier.

In the United States, Christmas is celebrated on December 25th, and the season lasts until New Years Day. The holiday is celebrated with Christmas trees, lights, and decorations. Many Americans exchange gifts and attend church services on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. Some families also have the tradition of leaving cookies and milk for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.

On a more personal note, Our Christmas tree went up about the middle of September and will come down the first week of January in true Filipino tradition.
