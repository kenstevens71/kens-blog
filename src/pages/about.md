  As I said on the home page, my name is Ken Stevens. I identify, that is a PC
  term, if I ever heard one. These days people, even if they have the genitalia
  of a male, can identify as a female, or vice versa. This truly amazes me! How
  can people deny who or what they are? 
</p>
<p> 
  It just boggles my mind. Anyway I  digress, I have a habit of doing that. 
  Now, to get back to the topic at hand. I identify as a child of God. I was 
  saved at a very young age. Someone gave me a copy of The King James 
  translation of the bible when I was only 7 or 8 years old. I have always been 
  a very voracious reader. I was probably the only 7 or 8 year old that could 
  name all the ingredients in all the popular cereals because I would sit there 
  while I ate my breakfast and read the backs of the cereal boxes. 
  </p>

  I sat down and over the next couple of years I read The King James Translation 
  of the Bible from cover to cover. This is not an easy read for a 7 or 8 year 
  old. Of course, this raised many questions in my young, but inquisitive mind. 
  So, what is a person to do? I got busy, I asked Priests, Pastors, Elders, and 
  others my questions. I accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour 
  at around the age of 11. At age 15, I began my journey of Bible study seriously.

  Enough of my early age, now we zoom ahead. Most of my career, I spent my time 
  writing computer programs. That covers about 35 years of my life. Today, I 
  write, I read, I still study the Bible, I spend far more time than I should 
  in front of my computers. So enough time has been spent writing this ramble. 
  So by all means, stick around, read my blog and devotions and maybe, just 
  maybe you might learn something.
